Kalabox HTML1 Example
=====================

This contains a VERY basic HTML app example to get you kick started on working with Kalabox. It is most valuable when used in conjunction with the [Kalabox Docs](http://docs.kalabox.io). This app provides the following:

1. A static HTML site running the latest `nginx` at `http://html1.example.kbox`
3. An empty webroot inside your app in a `code` directory.
